# Binary-Classification-of-Scenery-Images

This project was to do a binary classification on scenery images downloaded from Kaggle. (dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification)

A convolution neural network with 3 convolutional layers and 2 fully-connected layers was used for binary classification.

The model attained an accuracy of 90% on the testing dataset (train/test ratio: 9:1)
